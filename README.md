This texture pack adds 'dark mode' variants of GUI's for a number of mods, including:


* Actually Additions
* MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod
* Chance Cubes
* Cyberware/Robotic Parts
* Scannable
* Storage Drawers
* Traveler's Backpack


...with more on the way!


Since this pack only replaces GUI's, it can be used with other texture packs!


This pack was created for Minecraft 1.12.2, but can likely be used on other versions. However, your mileage may vary.


This pack was inspired by and intended to be used alongside nebuIr's Default Dark Mode resource pack. All credit for color pallet and design goes to nebuIr.
