This texture pack adds 'dark mode' variants of GUI's for a number of mods, including:

* Actually Additions
* Chance Cubes
* Chisel
* Cyberware/Robotic Parts
* OpenSecurity
* Modular Force Field System
* MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod
* Refined Storage
* Storage Drawers
* Traveler's Backpack

...and many, many more!

Since this pack only replaces GUI's, it can be used with other texture packs!

This pack was inspired by and intended to be used alongside nebuIr's Default Dark Mode resource pack. All credit for color pallet and design goes to nebuIr. 

This pack was created for Minecraft 1.12.2, but can likely be used on other versions. Your mileage may vary. 

You may create an issue on Github to request a port to a specific version of Minecraft and I'll see what I can do.
